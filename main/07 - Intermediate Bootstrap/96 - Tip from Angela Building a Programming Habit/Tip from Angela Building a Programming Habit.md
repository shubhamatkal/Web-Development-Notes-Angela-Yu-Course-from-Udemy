# Tip from Angela Building a Programming Habit

We talk about the making of the queue, but we don't talk about the making of the habit. So, I want to talk about that today.

## 1. The Habit

The habit is the most important thing. The habit is what's going to make you a better programmer. The habit is what's going to make you a better developer. The habit is what's going to make you a better person. The habit is what's going to make you a better human being. The habit is what's going to make you a better friend. The habit is what's going to make you a better family member. The habit is what's going to make you a better person in general.

for example, if we are trying to make a habit of going to the gym, we have to make a habit of going to gym after some habit
