# How to become a Better Programmer Code Refactoring

We have to refactor our code to make it more :

1. Readable
2. Maintainable
3. Scalable

## Readable

> Code is written to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute.

> The most important property of software is that it is used. It is more important to be able to *reuse* software than to be able to *acquire* it.
