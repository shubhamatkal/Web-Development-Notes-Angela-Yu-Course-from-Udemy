<p>In order to remove the linker warnings and errors you might be getting in Atom, I recommend going into your Atom preferences and disabling the jshint linter and installing a Atom plugin called <a href="https://atom.io/packages/language-ejs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">language-ejs</a>.</p>
