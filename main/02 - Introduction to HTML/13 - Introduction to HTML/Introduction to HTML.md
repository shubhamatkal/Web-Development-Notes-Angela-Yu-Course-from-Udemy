The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style, or content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

## What is a Web Host?

A web host is a service that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet.

The web browser sends a request for a web page to a web server, which is a computer that stores and delivers web pages. The web server responds by sending back the requested web page to the web browser, which then interprets the codes and displays the information on your screen.
