# HTML Lists

## Introduction

Lists are a great way to organize information. There are three types of lists in HTML:

- Ordered lists
- Unordered lists
- Definition lists

## Ordered Lists

An ordered list is a list of items where the order is important. In an ordered list, each item is numbered. We use the `<ol>` tag to create an ordered list. Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag. The following is an example of an ordered list:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Learn HTML</li>
  <li>Learn CSS</li>
  <li>Learn JavaScript</li>
</ol>
```

## Unordered Lists

An unordered list is a list of items where the order is not important. In an unordered list, each item is marked with a bullet point. We use the `<ul>` tag to create an unordered list. Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag. The following is an example of an unordered list:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Learn HTML</li>
  <li>Learn CSS</li>
  <li>Learn JavaScript</li>
</ul>
```

## Definition Lists

A definition list is a list of terms, with the definition for each of those terms. We use the `<dl>` tag to create a definition list. Each term is placed between an opening `<dt>` tag and a closing `</dt>` tag. The definition is placed between an opening `<dd>` tag and a closing `</dd>` tag. The following is an example of a definition list:

```html
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>Hypertext Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
  <dt>JS</dt>
  <dd>JavaScript</dd>
</dl>
```
