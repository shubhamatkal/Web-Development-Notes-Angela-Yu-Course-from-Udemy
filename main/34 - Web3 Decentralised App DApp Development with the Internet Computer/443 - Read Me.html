<p>Hey,</p><p><br></p><p>Just a word of <strong>warning</strong>. I&nbsp;know that a lot of you are really keen to learn the latest technology and be able to start developing for Web3. But it's important to know that the course materials are placed at the end of this Web Development course for good reason. Because it's harder and <strong>more advanced</strong>. </p><p><br></p><p>In the next modules, I assume that you have <strong>already completed</strong> the previous parts of the course. And you are already familiar with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>vanilla JS</strong>, and you know how to build front-ends and back-ends. </p><p><br></p><p>If you have skipped the rest of the course to learn the Web3 section, then it will be very difficult unless you are already a web developer. So if you ever get confused, make sure that you go back and complete the previous parts of this course. </p><p><br></p><p>I love learning the new stuff too, but we need good foundations to build a good developer mind!</p><p><br></p><p>All the best,</p><p>Angela</p>
