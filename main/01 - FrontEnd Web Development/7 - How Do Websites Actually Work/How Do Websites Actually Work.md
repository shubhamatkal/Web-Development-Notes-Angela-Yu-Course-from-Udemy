# How Do Websites Actually Work

A website is a collection of web pages that are linked together by a common domain name². Web pages are files that contain codes, texts, images, videos and other elements that display information on the internet³. To view a website, you need a web browser and an internet connection. The web browser sends a request for a web page to a web server¹, which is a computer that stores and delivers web pages. The web server responds by sending back the requested web page to the web browser⁴, which then interprets the codes and displays the information on your screen.
