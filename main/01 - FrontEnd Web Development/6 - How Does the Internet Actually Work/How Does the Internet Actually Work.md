# How Does the Internet Actually Work

The internet is a network of networks. It's a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between each other. The internet is a collection of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the infrastructure to support email.
