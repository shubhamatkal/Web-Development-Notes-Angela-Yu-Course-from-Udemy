## What is a runtime

A runtime is a program that runs a program written in a specific language.

## What is V8

V8 is an open source javascript engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and used in Chrome and Nodejs. It compiles javascript code to native machine code instead of interpreting it.

## what it do

Nodejs is a javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 javascript engine. It is used to build fast and scalable network applications. It is open source and cross-platform. It is written in C++ and javascript.

currently, we have written javascript code that runs in the browser. Nodejs allows us to write javascript code that runs on the server. It is used to build fast and scalable network applications.

## why node

node can interact with the database directly, without having to go through a middleman like PHP or Ruby. This means that you can write your own database queries in javascript, which is a lot easier than writing them in SQL.

it can interact with the hardware directly, without having to go through a middleman like PHP or Ruby. This means that you can write your own hardware drivers in javascript, which is a lot easier than writing them in C++.

even the nodejs is used to make the atom editor, which is a text editor. the atom editor is written in javascript, which is a lot easier than writing it in C++.

## what is npm

npm is a package manager for javascript.
