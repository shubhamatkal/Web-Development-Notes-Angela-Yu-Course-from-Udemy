<p>Hey,</p><p>Hope you had fun learning and building authentication into our apps in this module. </p><p>You can find the completed source code for download in the resources for this lesson. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Authentication-Secrets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repository for this module</a> to checkout any of the check points and see the code at different levels of authentication. (If you don't remember how to, be sure to revisit the Git and GitHub module).</p><p>Wishing you all the best,</p><p>Your instructor, Angela</p><p><br></p>
