<p>Hey,</p><p><br></p><p>In the next lesson, I'll be showing you how to claim free cycles from the Dfinity Foundation. But at the time of writing, they require a GitHub account that is older than 3 months. Now, if you've been following the web development course, then you'll probably have that as we've introduced GitHub in module 21 already. </p><p><br></p><p>But if you don't have this then don't worry, you can complete all the Web3 components of the course without Cycles and you don't need to pay for Cycles if you don't want to. If you just want to learn the skills then you can deploy everything locally on your machine and ignore the parts where I ask you to deploy your project to the Internet Computer. Everything will work locally just as well as on the network!</p><p><br></p><p>All the best,</p><p><br></p><p>Angela</p><p><br></p>
