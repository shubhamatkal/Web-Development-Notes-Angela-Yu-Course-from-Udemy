# The Anatomy of CSS Syntax

## CSS Syntax

CSS syntax is the set of rules that define how CSS code is written. CSS syntax is very similar to the syntax of other programming languages. The following is an example of CSS syntax:

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

## CSS Syntax - The Selector

The selector is used to select the HTML element that you want to style. The selector can be an HTML element, a class, or an id.

## CSS Syntax - The Property

The property is the CSS property that you want to change. The property can be any CSS property, such as `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `margin-left`, and many others.

## CSS Syntax - The Value

The value is the value of the CSS property that you want to change. The value can be any value that the CSS property can take, such as `red`, `blue`, `20px`, `50px`, and many others.

## CSS Syntax - The `{` and `}` Brackets

The `{` and `}` brackets are used to group the selector, property, and value together. The brackets are also used to group multiple CSS properties together.

## CSS Syntax - The `;` Semicolon

The `;` semicolon is used to separate CSS properties. Each CSS property must be separated by a `;` semicolon.

## CSS Syntax - The `/*` and `*/` Comments

The `/*` and `*/` comments are used to add comments to CSS code. The comments are ignored by the browser and are used to make the code more readable.

## CSS Syntax - The `//` Comments

The `//` comments are used to add comments to CSS code. The comments are ignored by the browser and are used to make the code more readable.

## CSS Syntax - The `!important` Declaration

The `!important` declaration is used to override any other declarations. The `!important` declaration should be used with caution, as it is considered bad practice.

## CSS Syntax - The `@import` Rule

The `@import` rule is used to import a CSS file into another CSS file. The `@import` rule can be used multiple times to import multiple CSS files.

## CSS Syntax - The `@media` Rule

The `@media` rule is used to apply different CSS styles for different media types. The `@media` rule can be used to apply different CSS styles for different screen sizes.

## CSS Syntax - The `@font-face` Rule

The `@font-face` rule is used to define a custom font. The `@font-face` rule allows you to use a font that is not installed on the computer.

## CSS Syntax - The `@keyframes` Rule

The `@keyframes` rule is used to define CSS animations. The `@keyframes` rule allows you to create animations that change CSS properties over time.
