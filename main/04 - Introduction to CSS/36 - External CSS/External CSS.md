# External CSS

External CSS is a way to add CSS to an HTML document. It is done by adding a `<link>` element to the `<head>` section of an HTML document. The `<link>` element must have a `rel="stylesheet"` attribute to define it as a CSS document. The `<link>` element must also have a `href` attribute to define the path to the CSS document. The following is an example of an external CSS document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## External CSS - The `<link>` Element

The `<link>` element is used to link to external resources. The `<link>` element must have a `rel="stylesheet"` attribute to define it as a CSS document. The `<link>` element must also have a `href` attribute to define the path to the CSS document.

## External CSS - The `<head>` Element

The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML document. The `<head>` element is a container for all the head elements, including `<title>`, `<style>`, `<base>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<script>`, and `<noscript>`.

## External CSS - The `<html>` Element

The `<html>` element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

## External CSS - The `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
