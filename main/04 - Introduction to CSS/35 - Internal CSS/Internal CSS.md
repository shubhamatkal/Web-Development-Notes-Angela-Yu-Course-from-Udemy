# Internal CSS

Internal CSS is a way to add CSS to an HTML document. It is done by adding the `<style>` element to the `<head>` section of an HTML document. The `<style>` element can contain any CSS property. The following is an example of internal CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        background-color: linen;
      }

      h1 {
        color: maroon;
        margin-left: 40px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Internal CSS - The `<style>` Element

The `<style>` element is used to add CSS to an HTML document. The `<style>` element can contain any CSS property.

## Internal CSS - The `<head>` Element

The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML document. The `<head>` element is a container for all the head elements, including `<title>`, `<style>`, `<base>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<script>`, and `<noscript>`.

## Internal CSS - The `<html>` Element

The `<html>` element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

## Internal CSS - The `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
