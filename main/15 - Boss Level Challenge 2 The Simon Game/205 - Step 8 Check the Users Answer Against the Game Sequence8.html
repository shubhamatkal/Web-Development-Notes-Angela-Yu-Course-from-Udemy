<p>At this point, it might be worth reviewing how the Simon game works. </p><p>Firstly, the game shows the first colour in the sequence (blue). The user clicks on the blue button. </p><p>Next, the game shows the next colour (red), the user has to remember the sequence is blue, red and so on and so forth.</p><p>If the user messes up the sequence, then the game ends. </p><figure><img src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2018-11-22_12-47-22-8bcfca3d023a952c07c651c8dd7714bd.gif"></figure><p>You can either try to figure out how to achieve this logic by trying to write the code yourself or you can follow the challenge steps below:</p><p>1. Create a new function called <code>checkAnswer()</code>, it should take one input with the name <code>currentLevel</code></p><p>2. Call <code>checkAnswer() </code>after a user has clicked and chosen their answer, passing in the <strong>index of the last answer</strong> in the user's sequence.</p><p>e.g. If the user has pressed <strong>red, green, red, yellow,</strong> the index of the last answer is <strong>3.</strong></p><p>3. Write an <strong>if statement</strong> inside <code>checkAnswer()</code> to check if the most recent user answer is the same as the game pattern. If so then <strong>log</strong> "<code>success</code>", otherwise <strong>log</strong> "<code>wrong</code>".</p><p>You can now use these log statements along with logging the values of <code>userClickedPattern</code> and <code>gamePattern</code> in the <strong>Chrome Developer Tools</strong> console to check whether if your code is performing as you would expect and <strong>debug</strong> your code as needed. Once you're done, feel free to remove these log statements.</p><p>4. If the user got the most recent answer <strong>right </strong>in step 3, then check that they have finished their sequence with another if statement.</p><p>5. Call <code>nextSequence()</code> after a <strong>1000 millisecond</strong> delay. </p><p>6. Once <code>nextSequence()</code> is triggered, reset the <code>userClickedPattern</code> to an <strong>empty array </strong>ready for the next level.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you should be able to play the game.</p><figure><img src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2018-11-22_13-02-31-ac4fa16ac321cb9133eef978b1d1937b.gif"></figure><p><br></p><p>In the next few challenges, we'll address what happens when the user get's the pattern wrong and how to restart the game. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
