<p>1. In the same way we played sound in <code>nextSequence()</code> , when a user <strong>clicks on a button</strong>, the corresponding sound should be played. e.g if the Green button is clicked, then green.mp3 should be played. </p><p>2. Create a new function called <code>playSound()</code> that takes a single <strong>input</strong> parameter called <code>name</code>.</p><p>3. Take the code we used to play sound in the <code>nextSequence()</code> function and move it to <code>playSound()</code>.</p><p>4. Refactor the code in playSound() so that it will work for both playing sound in <code>nextSequence()</code> and when the user <strong>clicks a button</strong>. </p>
