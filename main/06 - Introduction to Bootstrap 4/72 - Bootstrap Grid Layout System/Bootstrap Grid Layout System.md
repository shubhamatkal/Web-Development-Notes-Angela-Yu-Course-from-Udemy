# Bootstrap Grid Layout System

Bootstrap provides a grid system that is used to create page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content. The grid system is based on a 12-column layout and it's built with flexbox and media queries. This means that the grid will behave differently depending on the size of the screen.
