# Tip from Angela How to Deal with Procrastination

How I deal with procrastination

prepare for everything in advance (e.g. prepare the next day's clothes the night before)

set a timer for 25 minutes and work on a task for 25 minutes

take a 5 minute break

repeat

I use the Pomodoro Technique to deal with procrastination. I set a timer for 25 minutes and work on a task for 25 minutes. Then I take a 5 minute break. I repeat this process until I finish the task. I find that this technique helps me to stay focused and get things done.

I also find that it helps to prepare for everything in advance. For example, I prepare the next day's clothes the night before. I also prepare my lunch the night before. I find that this helps me to get out of bed in the morning and get to work on time.
