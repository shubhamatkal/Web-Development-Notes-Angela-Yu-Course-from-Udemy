<p>We're going to turn the previous BMI calculator code we wrote into a real website using what we've learnt in this
    module. Follow the steps below to complete the challenge:</p>
<p>1. Create a new file called <strong>bmiCalculator.html</strong> inside the Calculator folder from the last challenge 
</p>
<p>2. Add the <strong>HTML boilerplate</strong> and set the page title to BMI Calculator</p>
<p>3. Add an <strong>HTML form</strong>, this form will make a <strong>post request</strong> to our server at the route
    <code>/bmicalculator</code>. The form will have 2 inputs, weight and height with placeholder text that tell the user
    what they should type into which text box. </p>
<p>4. Add a button which says “Caculate BMI”</p>
<p>5. Add the get and post methods for the <code>/bmicalculator</code> route into the same server.js file we've been
    using</p>
<p>6. Use sendFile() to send the <strong>bmiCalculator.html </strong>page as a response inside the get method.</p>
<p>6. Add an h1 that says <strong>BMI Calculator</strong></p>
<p>7. Inside server.js , create 2 variables, one for weight and one for height. </p>
<p>8. Use the BMI calculator code you wrote previously, or write some new code to calculate and send back the result as
    text. It should read something like "Your BMI is <strong>n</strong>" where n is equal to the calculated BMI based on
    their weight and height inputs.</p>
