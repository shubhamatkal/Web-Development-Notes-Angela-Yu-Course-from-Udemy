# What is Express

Express is a web framework for Node.js. It makes it easy to create servers by providing a set of tools and libraries that simplify the process.

Express is similar to jQuery in that it provides a layer of abstraction that makes it easier to work with the underlying platform. In the case of Express, the underlying platform is Node.js.

Without Express, you would have to write a lot of boilerplate code to create a server. Express removes this boilerplate code, making it much easier to get started.

Here is an analogy that may help you understand the difference between Express and Node.js:

Node.js is like a screwdriver. You can use a screwdriver to build a house, but it will take a long time and effort.
Express is like a motorized screwdriver. It makes it much easier and faster to build a house.
In other words, Express is a tool that makes it easier to use Node.js to create servers.

Here are some of the benefits of using Express:

It is easy to learn and use.
It is lightweight and efficient.
It is highly customizable.
It has a large and active community.
If you are interested in creating servers with Node.js, I recommend using Express. It is a great way to get started and to build powerful and scalable servers.
